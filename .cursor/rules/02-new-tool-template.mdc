When creating a new agent for the swarm, follow these steps and principles.

### 1. Define the Agent's Role and Tools

First, define the agent's specific purpose. Then, create the tools it needs to fulfill that purpose.

```python
# Example for a new "CarRentalAgent"
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def book_car(rental_company: str, car_type: str) -> str:
    """Books a rental car."""
    # ... implementation ...
    return f"Successfully booked a {car_type} from {rental_company}."

car_rental_tools = [book_car]
